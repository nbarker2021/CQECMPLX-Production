# Paper 16 - Continuum Edge Residuals

## Abstract

This paper defines continuum edge residuals as local window receipts. The
closed result is local: every chart state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state
in at most three `S3` steps, the edge residue is exactly the state condition
`C=1, R=0`, and power-of-ten windows provide a practical way to sample the
boundary between resolved interior and newly exposed depth. The global
continuum limit is not closed here. The collapse of the propagating correction
sum from `O(N)` to `O(log N)` remains the McKay-Thompson parity obligation.

## Claims

**Claim 16.1.** Every local chart state closes to a Lie-conjugate rest state in
at most three `S3` transposition steps.

**Claim 16.2.** There are exactly four Lie-conjugate rest states.

**Claim 16.3.** Edge residue is exactly `C AND NOT R`, so it fires only at
`(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`.

**Claim 16.4.** Power-of-ten windows are valid local receipt windows.

**Claim 16.5.** Local/oracle nth-bit checks pass with correction included, but
the global correction collapse remains open.

## Definitions

A **rollout** is the local process of reading a state until it reaches rest.

A **Lie-conjugate rest state** is an `L=R` chart state.

An **edge residual** is a carry in flight at a window boundary:

```text
edge_residue(L,C,R) = C AND NOT R
```

A **power-of-ten window** is a practical aperture at depths `10`, `100`,
`1000`, and so on. It is a receipt window, not a continuum proof.

## Theorem 16

Continuum edge residuals are locally well-defined window receipts:

```text
local state -> <=3-step rest closure -> edge_residue = C AND NOT R
```

and every global continuum claim remains an obligation until the propagating
correction sum is closed.

## Proof

The centroid verifier checks all eight chart states and reports local closure.
Every state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state in at most three `S3` steps.
This proves Claim 16.1.

The rest states are the four states satisfying `L=R`. The verifier reports the
count as `4`. This proves Claim 16.2.

The edge-residue formula is `C AND NOT R`. Exhausting all eight states gives
exactly `(0,1,0)` and `(1,1,0)`. This proves Claim 16.3.

The verifier samples windows at `10`, `100`, and `1000`. For each window it
records the selected local state, edge-residue value, anneal step count, and
final rest state. Each sampled window closes locally. This proves Claim 16.4 as
a local receipt statement.

The nth-bit layer passes with local/oracle correction included, but the receipt
names McKay-Thompson correction parity as open. Therefore the local edge
residual is admitted while global continuum collapse is not. This proves Claim
16.5.

Together these claims prove the theorem.

Receipt:

```

Closed layers:

```text
every local chart state anneals to a Lie-conjugate rest state in <=3 S3 steps
there are four Lie-conjugate rest states
edge residue is exactly C and not R
sample decade windows carry local receipts
local/oracle nth-bit layer passes with correction included
```

Open layers:

```text
global continuum closure
O(N) to O(log N) propagating-correction collapse
closed McKay-Thompson correction parity
claim that adding digits terminates continuum depth
```

## Falsifiers

The paper fails if any local chart state needs more than three anneal steps.

It fails if edge residue fires outside `C=1, R=0`.

It fails if power-of-ten windows are treated as a completed continuum limit.

It fails if the McKay-Thompson parity obligation is hidden.

## Role in the Suite

Paper 15 exports a residue carrier. Paper 16 turns that carrier into a windowed
edge reading. Paper 17 may use the windowed residual as an input to the
error-correction tower only by carrying the open global-collapse boundary.

## Conclusion

Paper 16 closes the local edge-residual instrument. It does not close the
continuum limit. That distinction lets later papers use powers of ten as
inspectable windows while preserving the deeper obligation.
